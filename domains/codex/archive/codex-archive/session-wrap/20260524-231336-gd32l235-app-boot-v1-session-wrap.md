# gd32l235_app_boot_v1 session wrap - 2026-05-24

## Scope

- Repository: `~/work/mcu/gd32l235_app_boot_v1`
- Branch: `master`
- Baseline at resumed session start: `fd6f790 refactor(app): 拆分电机反馈解析流程`
- Current HEAD at wrap: `766485c refactor(app): 继续压缩协议与OTA函数`
- Working tree at wrap: clean for tracked files; `scratch/` remains untracked.

## Completed Work

### App boundary and protocol refactor

- Continued narrow function splitting across App protocol, motor protocol, OTA/IAP, power, ADC, and runtime-adjacent modules.
- Preserved externally visible protocol command values and response payload contracts.
- Kept legacy aggregate header removal in place: `App/include/app/My_include.h` remains deleted and contract-protected.
- Preserved OTA write-flag and D5 NACK recovery contract visibility after helper extraction.

## Drift / Functional Parity Findings

Deep read-only comparison against `~/work/mcu/gd32l235` found no clear production feature loss in `gd32l235_app_boot_v1`.

Confirmed parity:

- Protocol command values match for existing production commands.
- Old repo's 30 handled inbound commands are all handled in the refactored repo.
- Motor protocol command/register constants match.
- Firmware version remains `1.1.19`.
- Charge enable/current/temp range controls are present.
- Hall calibration status command and register support are present.
- OTA/IAP status and retry behavior remain covered by contracts.
- Outbound reports are present: heartbeat, battery gauge, motor data, IR, IR distance, charge station, shutdown/runtime/aux reports.

Known differences:

- `CMD_BATTARY_GAUGE` was renamed to `CMD_BATTERY_GAUGE`; numeric value remains `0x30`.
- Legacy `vofa.c/h` debug helper was not migrated. It appeared only included by old `My_include.h`; no production call to `JustFloat()` was found. Treat as debug residual unless VOFA float streaming is still required.
- App image grew from about `40116` to `43988` bytes flash usage; still within budget but flash headroom is lower.

## Decisions and Lessons

- Keep protocol/static contract tokens visible when tests assert function-body structure. Several helper extractions had to preserve exact strings in parent helpers.
- Use one writer per file for subagent work. Parallel refactor succeeded when write scopes were disjoint.
- Treat `commit-ready` `COMMIT_NOT_STAGED` warnings as suspect when local `git status` clearly shows staged files; record the discrepancy, but rely on repository-local evidence.
- Prefer `--stat`, targeted `rg`, and small `sed` windows for cross-repo comparison. Broad `diff --no-index` over full repository pulls in `.git`, build outputs, and toolchain noise.

## Remaining Risks

- `scratch/` remains untracked and intentionally excluded from commits.
- `~/codex/docs/archive` still has unrelated dirty archive changes reported by session coach; they are outside the MCU repo.
- Functional parity was checked statically plus via quick contracts. Board-level HIL is still needed for high-confidence timing/IO behavior.
- App flash headroom is lower than the baseline repo and should be watched in future feature work.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Run board-level command sweep for all old handled commands and new diagnostic commands.
- Run full OTA HIL: begin/write/set-offset/verify/clear/commit/reboot, including D5 recovery and resume.
- Validate charging control on hardware: upper enable, current level, temp recover/cutoff.
- Validate factory bridge raw RX/TX under concurrent motor parse and protocol load.
- Decide whether VOFA float debug streaming is deprecated or should be reintroduced behind a debug-only interface.
